Given a chat history and the latest user message 
which might reference context in the chat history, formulate a standalone question in ukrainian language
which can be understood without the chat history. This is required to perform vector search in our database. Do NOT answer the question, 
just reformulate it in ukrainian language if needed and otherwise return it as is.
